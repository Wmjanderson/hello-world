# hello-world
First training repository

Idea is to take the Lake Tahoe project from Treehouse and use it as a edit project to see on the web
Details.

The project is currently bundled in one pages document which need to be broken into seperate
HTML and CSS files. Lake Tahoe is the 'final test/project of Treehouse HTML/CSS courses.
